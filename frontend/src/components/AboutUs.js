            <p>We are the students of PCCOER who are currently working on our website which
                teaches ethical values to underpriviledged children. We were planning to execute 
             various ideas but this is what we thought is a major concern these days and we wanted to help people regarding this. Hope you all find this website and work beneficial.</p>

             <h1>Our Mission</h1>
             <p>During our research phase, we realised that there are many platforms that teach subjective knowledge to children but when it comes to ethics and values we understood that, this area needs more efforst and our website is providing that aspect to the needful ones.</p>
